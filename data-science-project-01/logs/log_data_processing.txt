**Housing Prices Dataset**

**Context:**
This dataset is a simple yet challenging project, to predict the housing price based on certain factors like house area, bedrooms, furnished, nearness to main road, etc. The dataset is suitable for beginners to practice their regression skills.

**Content:**
The dataset contains the following columns:
- `price`: The price of the house.
- `area`: The area of the house in square feet.
- `bedrooms`: The number of bedrooms in the house.
- `bathrooms`: The number of bathrooms in the house.
- `stories`: The number of stories (floors) in the house.
- `mainroad`: Whether the house is near the main road (yes/no).
- `guestroom`: Whether the house has a guest room (yes/no).
- `basement`: Whether the house has a basement (yes/no).
- `hotwaterheating`: Whether the house has hot water heating (yes/no).
- `airconditioning`: Whether the house has air conditioning (yes/no).
- `parking`: The number of parking spaces available.
- `prefarea`: Whether the house is in a preferred area (yes/no).
- `furnishingstatus`: The furnishing status of the house (furnished/semi-furnished/unfurnished).

**Acknowledgements:**
The dataset is provided by Yasser H. and is available on Kaggle.

**Inspiration:**
This dataset can be used to practice regression techniques and to understand the impact of various factors on housing prices.
